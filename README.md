Power BI Dashboard

Interactive Financial Dashboard built with Power BI, SQL, and Excel to turn raw credit card transaction data into actionable business insights. Features custom KPIs, trend analysis, and customer segmentation—helping identify revenue spikes, high-value clients, and growth opportunities at a glance.

Project Objective:
-I wanted to turn raw financial data into something that’s not just numbers on a spreadsheet, but a story you can actually see and understand.
-This dashboard combines SQL and Excel data into an interactive Power BI report that helps track credit card usage, customer trends, and key financial metrics—making it easier to spot patterns, risks, and opportunities at a glance.

Dataset & Sources:
-SQL Database – Pulled transaction data, customer details, and credit card activity.
-Excel Sheets – Added extra reports like customer additions and weekly performance logs.
-Data Cleaning – Fixed missing values, standardized date formats, merged datasets using customer IDs, and made sure everything was consistent before analysis.

Steps:
-Queried and exported data from SQL.
-Cleaned and organized files in Excel (formatted columns, removed duplicates, fixed errors).
-Loaded the cleaned data into Power BI and built relationships between tables.
-Created custom measures (e.g., total spend, avg. transaction value, month-over-month growth).
-Designed visuals: bar charts, line graphs, KPIs, and interactive filters for deep-dive analysis.
-Iterated until the dashboard was clean, intuitive, and easy to navigate.

Key Insights:
-Mid-month sees the highest spike in credit card usage—likely linked to billing cycles.
-A small group of customers generates a disproportionate share of revenue, suggesting high-value client segments.
-Newly onboarded customers start small but increase their spending over time, showing growth potential.

Action Items:
Connect to a live SQL source for real-time updates.
Add forecasting models to predict future spend patterns.
Create customer segmentation for targeted marketing strategies.
Integrate the dashboard into presentations for quick, data-driven decision-making.
